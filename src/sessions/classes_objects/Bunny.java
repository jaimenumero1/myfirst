    //what is the purpose of overloading constructors?
    //Always take deep down.. Start from the fundamentals.
    //Since contructors are used to create objects
    //and give the object initial state by initializing the
    //instance variables with values coming from the Constructor param.
    //Overloading constructors give us an ability to to take only necessary info
    // and skip some of the instance variables uninitialized.


//Object have state and behavior, nothing else.
    //Note: next notes are specific to this class

    //by creating an object with no arg constructor we are creating Bunny object
    //whose state is default. so color is null, length and height is 0,gender is /000

        //created using this constructor.
        //Only color is initialized in the state of the bunny created using this constructor.
        //every other state info is defaulted.
